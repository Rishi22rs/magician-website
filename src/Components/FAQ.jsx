          <br /> When looking for a magician, there are several things to
          consider:
          <br />
          <br /> <strong>Experience:</strong> Look for a magician with years of
          experience performing for live audiences. This will ensure they have
          the skills and expertise to put on a great show. Reviews and
          testimonials: Read reviews and testimonials from previous clients to
          get a sense of how well the magician was received by their audience.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Repertoire:</strong> Ask the magician what types of tricks and
          illusions they perform. You want to ensure they have a wide variety of
          material to keep your guests engaged throughout the night.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Interactivity:</strong> A great magician will engage with
          their audience and make them a part of the show. Look for a magician
          skilled at interacting with the crowd and keeping them engaged.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Professionalism:</strong> Make sure the magician you hire is
          professional, punctual, and easy to work with. They should be able to
          answer all of your questions and be willing to work with you to create
          a memorable experience for your guests.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Photos and videos:</strong> Ensure the magician has plenty of
          photos and videos of them performing in similar situations.
